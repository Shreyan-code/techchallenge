/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all user data is private.
 * A user can only access and modify their own documents. The rules are designed for rapid prototyping,
 * focusing strictly on authorization (who can access what) while remaining flexible on the specific
 * shape of the data being written.
 *
 * Data Structure: All user data is stored in a top-level `/users` collection. Each user's data is
 * contained in a single document where the document ID is the user's Firebase Authentication UID.
 * This path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}`) is simple, performant, and avoids the need for
 * slow, costly `get()` calls in security rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Privacy: Listing the entire `/users` collection is strictly prohibited to prevent exposing
 *   user information. A user can only `get` their own profile document directly.
 * - Ownership Integrity: On creation, the rules validate that the `id` field within a user's
 *   profile document matches their UID in the path. This `id` field is then enforced as immutable
 *   to maintain relational integrity throughout the document's lifecycle.
 * - Default Deny: Any path or operation not explicitly allowed is denied by default.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: Not required for this data model. The structure uses the user's
 * UID as the document key (`/users/{userId}`), which provides a direct and performant way to
 * authorize access without needing to read other documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Not applicable. User data is inherently private and stored in a single
 * user-scoped collection.
